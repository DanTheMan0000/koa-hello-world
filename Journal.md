## This journal will be used for recording my progress, by answering the following four questions at the end of each completed milestone.


1. What did you make in this milestone?
2. What was confusing to you (git, javascript, etc)?
3. What makes sense (git, github, javascript, etc...)?
4. What would you like to see changed to make it easier for you? (regular meetings? more direction? smaller tasks?)

Milestone #1 Build A Base Web Application
  1. In this milestone I created a web page that displayed "Hello World" in a text/html format. Also I created a journal folder called Journal.md to keep track of my progress and difficulties.
  2. The hardest part for me was to remember the coding phrases that i have used before but not that often, I think with time It will get easier though.
  3. I think I have a fairly good grasp on github, and javascript, but still have a lot to learn.
  4. A little more guidance would be nice, because google and youtube can only get me so far without getting confusing.
